🔐 **Password Generator Tool** 🔐
I've created a simple Password Generator using Python and tkinter. This tool allows you to generate secure and random passwords with various options.

## Features:
- Generate random passwords of a specified length.
- Customize your password by including/excluding:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Symbols

## How to use:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the `password_generator.py` script.
3. Configure your password preferences.
4. Click "Generate Password" to create your password.
5. Click "Copy to Clipboard" to easily copy the generated password.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (for the GUI)
- pyperclip (for clipboard functionality)

You can find the full source code in the https://github.com/NabilPevekar/password_generator_tool/edit/main. Feel free to contribute, open issues, or suggest improvements.

Happy password generating! 💪🔒
